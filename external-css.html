            Sunday  
    </h1>
    
       
            You are the start of the week<br>
            or the end of it, and according<br>
            to The Beatles you creep in<br>
            like a nun. You're the second<br>
            full day the kids have been<br>
            away with their father, the second<br>
            full day of an empty house.<br>
            Sunday, I've missed you. I've been<br>
            sitting in the backyard with a glass<br>
            of Pinot waiting for your arrival.<br>
            Did you know the first Sweet 100s<br>
            are turning red in the garden,<br>
            but the lettuce has grown<br>
            too bitter to eat. I am looking<br>
            up at the bluest sky I have ever seen,<br>
            cerulean blue, a heaven sky<br>
            no one would believe I was under.<br>
            You are my witness. No day<br>
            is promised. You are absolution.<br>
            You are my unwritten to-do list,<br>
            my dishes in the sink, my brownie<br>
            breakfast, my braless day.<br>
